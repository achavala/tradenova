## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### **Backtest Limitations:**
1. **Options Data:** Uses current options chain as approximation (historical options data limited)
2. **Price Execution:** Assumes perfect fills at historical prices
3. **Risk Checks:** Simplified (no full risk manager simulation)

### **What This Shows:**
- ✅ System generates signals consistently
- ✅ Both LONG and SHORT signals handled correctly
- ✅ All signals pass basic checks
- ✅ System is very active (12 signals per day)

### **What's Missing:**
- Actual option prices and execution
- Position limit enforcement (max 10)
- Risk manager full simulation
- Profit/loss calculations
